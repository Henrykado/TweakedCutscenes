# Tweaked Cutscenes
 
Fork of the [SADX Cutscene Decompilation](https://github.com/X-Hax/SADX-cutscene-decompilation)


## List of Changes

This list may be missing some changes since i didn't keep track of all of them while making the mod. 
Also i am not a native english speaker, meaning that this list will probably have a few grammatical errors.

More "minor" changes won't be listed (e.g. better wait times between voice lines, actions and events so the cutscenes flow better, and/or improved lip syncing), however i will include a list of cutscenes that *only* have these "minor" changes at the end of this list.

The 2/3 numbers and/or letters that precede the name i gave to the cutscenes are the hexadecimal 'IDs' of those cutscenes. 
You can see them in the Debug tab of the SADX Mod Manager (they are preceded by EV and 1/2 zeroes), where you can choose a cutscene (referred to as "Events") and play them.
